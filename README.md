# Database System Principles Project 1


This project implements a simplified database storage system that simulates **file storage**, **B+ tree indexing** and **Deletion of records from B+ tree**.  
It demonstrates fundamental concepts in database systems such as:
- Record and block (page) management  
- Page buffering  
- Indexing using B+ Trees  
- Efficient data retrieval from simulated disk storage
